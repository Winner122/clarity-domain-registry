# Decentralized Domain Registry

A blockchain-based domain name registry system built on the Stacks network. This contract allows users to:

- Register domain names
- Create and manage subdomains
- Transfer domain ownership
- Renew domain registrations
- Query domain information and ownership

Domain names are registered for a period of one year and can be renewed before expiration.

## Features

- Decentralized ownership of domain names
- Prevention of duplicate registrations
- Support for subdomains (up to 20 per domain)
- Domain transfers between users
- Domain expiration and renewal system
- Query functions for domain availability and ownership

## Subdomain Support

The registry now supports creating subdomains under registered domain names. Domain owners can:

- Create subdomains under their registered domains
- Manage multiple subdomains (up to 20) per domain
- Transfer entire domains including their subdomains
- Query subdomain information and ownership

Subdomains follow the format: `subdomain.domain.tld`
